Hi, my name is Ryan Jenks. I am a goalkeeper who lives in Menifee, California. I am an '07 and play on the NPL team for Albion SC North in San Marcos, California. I have been playing soccer ever since I can remember. I started playing for my first club team when I was around 8 years old and loved it so much that I continued playing. At around age 9, the team I was on needed a goalie, so I decided to give it a try. My dad played goalie when he was a teenager all the way through college so I felt like it would be cool for me to do so as well. I immediately fell in love with the position, and it made my passion for soccer even greater. I started going to the goalie trainings my club offered and eventually began private goalie training sessions. I worked hard and continued seeing improvement, which helped fuel my fire to become the best goalkeeper I could be.

Now, here I am today, still playing goalie and absolutely loving every second of it. Soccer has definitely become a huge part of my life, but something else that is greatly important to me is school. I really like learning new things, and I also love working to be the best I can in all my classes. As a student athlete in high school, it is difficult at times to stay on top of soccer and assignments, but I always work to put in the effort and time that will help me excel at both. I will graduate from high school in 2025, and I am so looking forward to attending college.  It has been a long-time dream of mine to go to college and be able to play soccer for my college team, and as I get older that dream has only gotten bigger. My hope after high school is to continue playing soccer and continue studying and learning about the things I love to do.
