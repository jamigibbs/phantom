I am a research assistant at [**BiWell Lab**](https://yuhanlolo.github.io/me/lab.html), supervised by [Dr. Yuhan Luo](https://yuhanlolo.github.io/me/). As a researcher in the field of HCI, I design and evaluate conversational user interfaces (CUIs) in the context of people's daily health and well-being. Broadly, my research lies in the intersection of persuasive technology (PT), ubiquitous computing (ubicomp), social computing and personal informatics (PI).
